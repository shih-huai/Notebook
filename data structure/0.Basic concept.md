# Basic concept

## What is Data Structure

A **data structure** is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

## Classification of Data Structure

1. **Linear Data Structure** : Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 

   ***Array, Stack, Queue, Linked list, etc.***

2. **Static Data Structure** : Static data structure has a **fixed memory size**. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 

   *** Array***

3. **Dynamic Data Structure** : In dynamic data structure, **the size is not fixed**. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.
   ***Queue, Stack, etc***

4. **Non-Linear Data Structure** : Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in a single run only. 

   *** Trees, Graphs***



Something need to learn : time complexity
